samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Here below we have added theory of flutter's basic concepts:

Flutter Tutorial
Our Flutter Tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of the Flutter framework. Flutter is a UI toolkit for building fast, beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop with one programing language and single codebase. It is free and open-source. Initially, it was developed from Google and now manages by an ECMA standard. Flutter apps use Dart programming language for creating an app.

The first version of Flutter was announced in the year 2015 at the Dart Developer Summit. It was initially known as codename Sky and can run on the Android OS. On December 4, 2018, the first stable version of the Flutter framework was released, denoting Flutter 1.0. The current stable release of the framework is Flutter v1.9.1+hotfix.6 on October 24, 2019.

What is Flutter?
In general, creating a mobile application is a very complex and challenging task. There are many frameworks available, which provide excellent features to develop mobile applications. For developing mobile apps, Android provides a native framework based on Java and Kotlin language, while iOS provides a framework based on Objective-C/Swift language. Thus, we need two different languages and frameworks to develop applications for both OS. Today, to overcome form this complexity, there are several frameworks have introduced that support both OS along with desktop apps. These types of the framework are known as cross-platform development tools.

The cross-platform development framework has the ability to write one code and can deploy on the various platform (Android, iOS, and Desktop). It saves a lot of time and development efforts of developers. There are several tools available for cross-platform development, including web-based tools, such as Ionic from Drifty Co. in 2013, Phonegap from Adobe, Xamarin from Microsoft, and React Native form Facebook. Each of these frameworks has varying degrees of success in the mobile industry. In recent, a new framework has introduced in the cross-platform development family named Flutter developed from Google.

Flutter is a UI toolkit for creating fast, beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop with one programing language and single codebase. It is free and open-source. It was initially developed from Google and now manages by an ECMA standard. Flutter apps use Dart programming language for creating an app. The dart programming shares several same features as other programming languages, such as Kotlin and Swift, and can be trans-compiled into JavaScript code.

Flutter is mainly optimized for 2D mobile apps that can run on both Android and iOS platforms. We can also use it to build full-featured apps, including camera, storage, geolocation, network, third-party SDKs, and more.

What makes Flutter unique?
Flutter is different from other frameworks because it neither uses WebView nor the OEM widgets that shipped with the device. Instead, it uses its own high-performance rendering engine to draw widgets. It also implements most of its systems such as animation, gesture, and widgets in Dart programing language that allows developers to read, change, replace, or remove things easily. It gives excellent control to the developers over the system.

Features of Flutter
Flutter gives easy and simple methods to start building beautiful mobile and desktop apps with a rich set of material design and widgets. Here, we are going to discuss its main features for developing the mobile framework.

Flutter Tutorial
Open-Source: Flutter is a free and open-source framework for developing mobile applications.

Cross-platform: This feature allows Flutter to write the code once, maintain, and can run on different platforms. It saves the time, effort, and money of the developers.

Hot Reload: Whenever the developer makes changes in the code, then these changes can be seen instantaneously with Hot Reload. It means the changes immediately visible in the app itself. It is a very handy feature, which allows the developer to fix the bugs instantly.

Accessible Native Features and SDKs: This feature allows the app development process easy and delightful through Flutter's native code, third-party integration, and platform APIs. Thus, we can easily access the SDKs on both platforms.

Minimal code: Flutter app is developed by Dart programming language, which uses JIT and AOT compilation to improve the overall start-up time, functioning and accelerates the performance. JIT enhances the development system and refreshes the UI without putting extra effort into building a new one.

Widgets: The Flutter framework offers widgets, which are capable of developing customizable specific designs. Most importantly, Flutter has two sets of widgets: Material Design and Cupertino widgets that help to provide a glitch-free experience on all platforms.

Advantage of Flutter
Flutter fulfills the custom needs and requirements for developing mobile applications. It also offers many advantages, which are listed below.

It makes the app development process extremely fast because of the hot-reload feature. This feature allows us to change or update the code are reflected as soon as the alterations are made.
It provides the smoother and seamless scrolling experiences of using the app without much hangs or cuts, which makes running applications faster in comparison to other mobile app development frameworks.
Flutter reduces the time and efforts of testing. As we know, flutter apps are cross-platform so that testers do not always need to run the same set of tests on different platforms for the same app.
It has an excellent user interface because it uses a design-centric widget, high-development tools, advanced APIs, and many more features.
It is similar to a reactive framework where the developers do not need to update the UI content manually.
It is suitable for MVP (Minimum Viable Product) apps because of its speedy development process and cross-platform nature.
Disadvantages of Flutter
We have seen earlier that the Flutter has many advantages, but it also contains some disadvantages, which are given below.

The Flutter is a comparatively new language that needs continuous integration support through the maintenance of scripts.
It provides very limited access to SDK libraries. It means a developer does not have a lot of functionalities to create a mobile application. Such types of functionalities need to be developed by the Flutter developer themselves.
The Flutter apps do not support the browser. It only supports Android and iOS platforms.
It uses Dart programming for coding, so a developer needs to learn new technologies. However, it is easy to learn for developers.
History of Flutter
Flutter is a free and open-source UI software development kit introduced by Google. It is used to build applications for Android, iOS, Windows, and the web. The first version of Flutter was announced in the year 2015 at the Dart Developer Summit. It was initially known as codename "Sky" and can run on the Android OS. After the announcement of Flutter, the first Flutter Alpha version (v-0.06) was released in May 2017.

Later, during the keynote of Google Developer days in Shanghai, Google launched the second preview of Flutter in September 2018 that was the last big release before Flutter 1.0 version. On December 4, 2018, the first stable version of the Flutter framework was released at the Flutter Live event, denoting Flutter 1.0. The current stable release of the framework is Flutter v1.9.1+hotfix.6 on October 24, 2019.

Step 11: Now, install Flutter and Dart plugin for building Flutter application in Android Studio. These plugins provide a template to create a Flutter application, give an option to run and debug Flutter application in the Android Studio itself.

Flutter Widgets
In this section, we are going to learn the concept of a widget, how to create it, and their different types available in the Flutter framework. We have learned earlier that everything in Flutter is a widget.

If you are familiar with React or Vue.js, then it is easy to understand the Flutter.

Whenever you are going to code for building anything in Flutter, it will be inside a widget. The central purpose is to build the app out of widgets. It describes how your app view should look like with their current configuration and state. When you made any alteration in the code, the widget rebuilds its description by calculating the difference of previous and current widget to determine the minimal changes for rendering in UI of the app.

Widgets are nested with each other to build the app. It means the root of your app is itself a widget, and all the way down is a widget also. For example, a widget can display something, can define design, can handle interaction, etc.

The below image is a simple visual representation of the widget tree.

Flutter Widgets
We can create the Flutter widget like this:

Class ImageWidget extends StatelessWidget {  
// Class Stuff  
}  
Hello World Example

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {    
MyHomePage({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);    
// This widget is the home page of your application.    
final String title;

@override    
Widget build(BuildContext context) {    
return Scaffold(    
appBar: AppBar(    
title: Text(this.title),    
),    
body: Center(    
child: Text('Hello World'),    
),    
);    
}    
}    
Types of Widget
We can split the Flutter widget into two categories:

Visible (Output and Input)
Invisible (Layout and Control)
Visible widget
The visible widgets are related to the user input and output data. Some of the important types of this widget are:

Text

A Text widget holds some text to display on the screen. We can align the text widget by using textAlign property, and style property allow the customization of Text that includes font, font weight, font style, letter spacing, color, and many more. We can use it as like below code snippets.

new Text(     
'Hello, Javatpoint!',     
textAlign: TextAlign.center,       
style: new TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),   
)  
Button

This widget allows you to perform some action on click. Flutter does not allow you to use the Button widget directly; instead, it uses a type of buttons like a FlatButton and a RaisedButton. We can use it as like below code snippets.

//FlatButton Example  
new FlatButton(  
child: Text("Click here"),  
onPressed: () {  
// Do something here  
},  
),

//RaisedButton Example  
new RaisedButton(  
child: Text("Click here"),  
elevation: 5.0,  
onPressed: () {  
// Do something here  
},  
),  
In the above example, the onPressed property allows us to perform an action when you click the button, and elevation property is used to change how much it stands out.

Image

This widget holds the image which can fetch it from multiple sources like from the asset folder or directly from the URL. It provides many constructors for loading image, which are given below:

Image: It is a generic image loader, which is used by ImageProvider.
asset: It load image from your project asset folder.
file: It loads images from the system folder.
memory: It load image from memory.
network: It loads images from the network.
To add an image in the project, you need first to create an assets folder where you keep your images and then add the below line in pubspec.yaml file.

assets:
- assets/  
  Now, add the following line in the dart file.

Image.asset('assets/computer.png')  
The complete source code for adding an image is shown below in the hello world example.

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {  
MyHomePage({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);  
// This widget is the home page of your application.  
final String title;

@override  
Widget build(BuildContext context) {  
return Scaffold(  
appBar: AppBar(  
title: Text(this.title),  
),  
body: Center(  
child: Image.asset('assets/computer.png'),  
),  
);  
}  
}  
When you run the app, it will give the following output.

Flutter Widgets
Icon

This widget acts as a container for storing the Icon in the Flutter. The following code explains it more clearly.

new Icon(  
Icons.add,  
size: 34.0,  
)  
Invisible widget
The invisible widgets are related to the layout and control of widgets. It provides controlling how the widgets actually behave and how they will look onto the screen. Some of the important types of these widgets are:

Column

A column widget is a type of widget that arranges all its children's widgets in a vertical alignment. It provides spacing between the widgets by using the mainAxisAlignment and crossAxisAlignment properties. In these properties, the main axis is the vertical axis, and the cross axis is the horizontal axis.

Example

The below code snippets construct two widget elements vertically.

new Column(  
mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,  
children: <Widget>[  
new Text(  
"VegElement",  
),  
new Text(  
"Non-vegElement"  
),  
],  
),  
Row

The row widget is similar to the column widget, but it constructs a widget horizontally rather than vertically. Here, the main axis is the horizontal axis, and the cross axis is the vertical axis.

Example

The below code snippets construct two widget elements horizontally.

new Row(  
mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,  
children: <Widget>[  
new Text(  
"VegElement",  
),  
new Text(  
"Non-vegElement"  
),  
],  
),  
Center

This widget is used to center the child widget, which comes inside it. All the previous examples contain inside the center widget.

Example

Center(  
child: new clumn(  
mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,  
children: <Widget>[  
new Text(  
"VegElement",  
),  
new Text(  
"Non-vegElement"  
),  
],  
),  
),  
Padding

This widget wraps other widgets to give them padding in specified directions. You can also provide padding in all directions. We can understand it from the below example that gives the text widget padding of 6.0 in all directions.

Example

Padding(  
padding: const EdgeInsets.all(6.0),  
child: new Text(  
"Element 1",  
),  
),  
Scaffold

This widget provides a framework that allows you to add common material design elements like AppBar, Floating Action Buttons, Drawers, etc.

Stack

It is an essential widget, which is mainly used for overlapping a widget, such as a button on a background gradient.

State Management Widget
In Flutter, there are mainly two types of widget:

StatelessWidget
StatefulWidget
StatefulWidget
A StatefulWidget has state information. It contains mainly two classes: the state object and the widget. It is dynamic because it can change the inner data during the widget lifetime. This widget does not have a build() method. It has createState() method, which returns a class that extends the Flutters State Class. The examples of the StatefulWidget are Checkbox, Radio, Slider, InkWell, Form, and TextField.

Example

class Car extends StatefulWidget {  
const Car({ Key key, this.title }) : super(key: key);

@override  
_CarState createState() => _CarState();  
}

class _CarState extends State<Car> {  
@override  
Widget build(BuildContext context) {  
return Container(  
color: const Color(0xFEEFE),  
child: Container(  
child: Container( //child: Container() )  
)  
);  
}  
}  
StatelessWidget
The StatelessWidget does not have any state information. It remains static throughout its lifecycle. The examples of the StatelessWidget are Text, Row, Column, Container, etc.

Example

class MyStatelessCarWidget extends StatelessWidget {  
const MyStatelessCarWidget ({ Key key }) : super(key: key);

@override  
Widget build(BuildContext context) {  
return Container(color: const Color(0x0xFEEFE));  
}  
}
